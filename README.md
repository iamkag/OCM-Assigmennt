# Text Classification and Data Insights

## Overview

This project encompasses two main components:
1. **Text Classification Model**: A robust NLP model built to classify text into predefined categories, with a focus on achieving high accuracy and exploring low-latency solutions.
2. **Data Analysis and Insights**: An analysis of real-time bidding data to uncover valuable insights and trends.

## Features

- **NLP Model**: Implementation of a high-accuracy text classification model.
- **Latency Optimization**: Design considerations to optimize for lower latency while retaining model accuracy.
- **Data Exploration**: Comprehensive analysis of programmatic advertising data to identify patterns and trends.

## Project Structure

- **`/Part-A`**: Contains the NLP model, training scripts, and optional tasks for extending label taxonomy.
- **`/Part-B`**: Scripts and notebooks for data analysis, exploring insights from the real-time bidding dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [List any specific libraries used in the project, such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.]

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamkag/OCM-Assigmennt/tree/main
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd NLP-and-Data-Analysis-Project
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Train the NLP Model**: Run the training script in `Part-A` to train the text classifier.
2. **Data Analysis**: Execute the scripts in `Part-B` to generate insights from the bidding data.
